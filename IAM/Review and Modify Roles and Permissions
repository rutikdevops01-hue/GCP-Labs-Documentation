SOP: Review and Modify Roles and Permissions in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Objective:
To review existing user roles and permissions in a GCP project and grant an additional IAM role to another user (principal).

Scope:
This SOP applies to GCP users who have Editor or Owner access to manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions within a Google Cloud project.

Prerequisites:
- Access to the Google Cloud Console.
- Logged in with the Qwiklabs student account having Editor permissions.
- Active GCP project (e.g., qwiklabs-gcp-04-82347ba63a83).

Procedure:

Step 1: Review Existing Roles and Permissions
1. Sign in to the Google Cloud Console.
2. From the Navigation menu (☰), go to: IAM & Admin → IAM
3. The IAM page displays a list of all users (principals) and their assigned roles.
4. Locate your Qwiklabs username, for example: student-01-70273e17a049@qwiklabs.net
5. Observe the following:
   - Principal column: Displays your user email.
   - Name column: Displays the username (e.g., student XXXXXXXX).
   - Role column: Displays Editor.

Role Details:
Viewer (roles/viewer): Read-only access; can view resources but not modify them.
Editor (roles/editor): Can view and modify resources, but cannot manage IAM roles or billing.
Owner (roles/owner): Full control over project; can manage IAM roles, permissions, and billing.

Step 2: Grant a New IAM Role
1. Navigate to IAM & Admin → IAM again.
2. Click on Grant Access.
3. In the Add principals field, enter the following user email:
   student-01-fc39110f0ebd@qwiklabs.net
4. Under Assign roles, open the Select a role dropdown.
5. Search for and select Viewer.
6. Click Save to apply the new role assignment.
7. Verify the addition:
   - The IAM list should now include the new principal.
   - The Role column should show Viewer for the newly added user.

Step 3: Verification
- Confirm that the second student account (student-01-fc39110f0ebd@qwiklabs.net) appears in the IAM list.
- Ensure the assigned role is Viewer.
- Confirm no unauthorized roles or users were modified.

Expected Outcome:
- You have successfully reviewed your existing permissions.
- You have successfully added a new user (principal) with the Viewer role in your GCP project.

Notes:
- Viewer role provides read-only access to project resources.
- Editor role allows creation and modification of resources but not IAM management.
- Only Owner role can modify IAM policies and billing settings.
- Always follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles.
